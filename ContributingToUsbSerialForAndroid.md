# CLA #

Before we can accept your patch, we need you to sign the [Google Contributor License Agreement](http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html).  (If you are a corporate entity, use the [corporate version](http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html)).

It's an online form and should take just a minute.  Once you've done it, please notify us (eg in the issue with your patch) so we can confirm.

## Why is there a CLA? ##

The project's author works at Google, and Google requires a CLA for all open source projects it releases.  The CLA protects both Google and the project from various undesirable legal liabilities.

Please see [ContributorLicenseAgreement on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contributor_License_Agreement) for more general information.

## Does this affect the license? ##

No.  All code remains LGPL licensed.
